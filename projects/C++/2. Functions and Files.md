## 2.1 Introduction to functions
- A **function** is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
- Functions that you write yourself are called **user-defined functions**.
- When making a function call the CPU essentially bookmarks the current point of execution.
	- It will execute the function.
	- It will then return to the point it bookmarked and resumes execution.
- The function initiating the function call is the **caller**.
- The function being executed is called the **callee**.

```cpp
returnType functionName() {
	...
};
```

- The first line is called the function header.
- Within the curly braces is called the function body.

- Nested functions are not allowed.

## 2.2 Function return values (value-returning functions)

- The return expression produces the value to be returned. The return value is a **copy** of that value.

### Revisiting main

- There are two special requirements for `main()`:
- `main()` is required to return an `int`.
- Explicit function calls to `main()` are disallowed.

- It's a common misconception that `main` is the first function that executes.
	- Global variables are inited prior to the execution of main.
	- If the initializer for that variable invokes a function, that function will execute prior to main.

### Status Codes

- The C++ standard only defines 3 status codes:
	- `0`
	- `EXIT_SUCCESS`
	- `EXIT_FAILURE`

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main() {
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

- Can ALL be used to maximise portability.

---
- A function that returns a value is called a **value-returning function**.
- A function is value-returning if the return type is anything other than `void`.
- A value-returning function that does not return a value will produce undefined behaviour.

- The only exception to this is main will return 0 if no return statement is given.

## 2.3 Void functions (non-value returning functions)

- A return type of `void` is used to tel the compiler does not return a value.
- `void` functions don't need a return value.
- Returning a value from a void function will result int a compiler failure.

## 2.4 Introduction to function parameters and arguments

- A **function parameter** are the inputs to a function.
- An argument is a value that is passed from the caller to the function when the function call is made.

- When a function is called, all of the parameters of the function are created as variables.
- The value of each of the arguments is copied into the matching parameter.
	- This process is called **pass by value**.
- Functions parameters that utilise pass by value are called **value parameters**.

- Parameters that are are not used in the body of a function are called **referenced parameters**.
- In cases where a function parameter needs to exist but is not used in the body of the function, the name can be omitted.
```cpp
void doSomething(int) {}
```

## 2.5 Introduction to local scope

- Variables defined in the body of the function are called **local variables**.
- Function parameters are also generally considered to be local variables.

Lifetimes:
- Local variables are destroyed in the opposite order of creation at the end of the set of curly braces in which it is defined.
```cpp
int add(int x, int y) {
	int z{x + y};
	return z;
} // z, y, x are destroyed here
```

 - So an object's lifetime is defined to be the time between its creation and destruction.
 - Variable creation and destruction can also happen at runtime. Therefore, lifetime is a property.

-  An identifier's scope determines where the identifier can be seen and used within the source code.
- When an identifier can be seen, we say it is **in scope**.
- Conversely, if it cannot be seen then we say it is **out of scope**.
- An identifier with **local scope** (technically called **block scope**) is usable from the point of the definition to the end of the innermost pair curly braces.

Out of scope vs going out of scope:
- An identifier is out of scope anywhere it cannot be accessed within the code.
- Going out of scope is typically applied to objects rather than identifiers.
	- The object goes out of scope at the end of the scope in which the object was instantiated.

A **temporary object** (also sometimes called a **anonymous object**) is an unnamed object that is used to hold a value that is only needed for a short amount of time.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getValueFromUser() {
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;
	return input;
}

int main() {
	std::cout << getValueFromUser() << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```
