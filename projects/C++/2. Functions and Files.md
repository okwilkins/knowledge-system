## 2.1 Introduction to functions
- A **function** is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
- Functions that you write yourself are called **user-defined functions**.
- When making a function call the CPU essentially bookmarks the current point of execution.
	- It will execute the function.
	- It will then return to the point it bookmarked and resumes execution.
- The function initiating the function call is the **caller**.
- The function being executed is called the **callee**.

```cpp
returnType functionName() {
	...
};
```

- The first line is called the function header.
- Within the curly braces is called the function body.

- Nested functions are not allowed.

## 2.2 Function return values (value-returning functions)

- The return expression produces the value to be returned. The return value is a **copy** of that value.

### Revisiting main

- There are two special requirements for `main()`:
- `main()` is required to return an `int`.
- Explicit function calls to `main()` are disallowed.

- It's a common misconception that `main` is the first function that executes.
	- Global variables are inited prior to the execution of main.
	- If the initializer for that variable invokes a function, that function will execute prior to main.

### Status Codes

- The C++ standard only defines 3 status codes:
	- `0`
	- `EXIT_SUCCESS`
	- `EXIT_FAILURE`

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main() {
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

- Can ALL be used to maximise portability.

---
- A function that returns a value is called a **value-returning function**.
- A function is value-returning if the return type is anything other than `void`.
- A value-returning function that does not return a value will produce undefined behaviour.

- The only exception to this is main will return 0 if no return statement is given.
