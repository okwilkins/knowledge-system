## 16.1 — Introduction to containers and arrays

### Containers

- Containers exist in programming to make it easier to create and manager collections objects.
- In general programming, a **container** is a data type that provides storage for a collection of unnamed objects (called **elements**).
- They are typically used when needing to work with a set of related values.

- The lessons so far have already been using one container type: strings.
	- A string container provides storage for a collection of characters, which can then be output as text.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
	std::string name{"Alex"}; // strings are a container for characters
	std::cout << name; // output the string as a sequence of characters
	
	return 0;
}
```

### Containers in C++

- The **Containers library** is a part of the C++ standard library that contains various class types that implement some common types of containers.
	- A class type that implements a container is sometimes called **container class**.
- In C++, the definition of a "container" is narrower than the general programming definition.
	- Only the class types in the Containers library are considered to be containers in C++.
	- The term "container" will be used when talking about contained in general and "container class" when talking specifically about the container class types that are part of the Containers library.
- The following types are containers under the general programming definition but are not considered to be containers by the C++ standard:
	- C-style arrays
	- `std::string`
	- `std::vector<bool>`
	- However, because `std::string` and `std::vector<bool>` implement most of the requirements, they behave like containers in most circumstances.
		- As a result they are sometimes called "pseudo-containers".
- Of the provided container classes, `std::vector` and `std::array` see by far the most use.

### Introduction to arrays

- An **array** is a container data type that stores a sequence of values contiguously.
	- Arrays allow fast, direct access to any element.
- C++ contains three primary array types:
	- C-style arrays
	- `std::string`
	- `std::vector`
- C-style arrays were inherited from the C language.
	- For backwards compatibility, these arrays are defined as part of the core C++ language, much like the fundamental data types.
	- The C++ standard calls these "arrays" but in modern C++ these are often called **C arrays** or **C-style arrays** in order to differentiate them from the similarly named `std::array`.
	- By **modern standards**, C-style arrays behave strangle and they are dangerous.
- To make arrays safer and easier to use in C++, the `std::vector` container class was introduced in C++03.
	- `std::vector` is the most flexible of the three array types and has a bunch of useful capabilities that the other array types don't.
- Finally, the `std::array` container class was introduced in C++11 as a direct replacement for C-style arrays.
	- It is more limited than `std::vector` but can be also be more efficient, especially for smaller arrays.
