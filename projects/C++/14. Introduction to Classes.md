- Up until now, the type of programming used is called **procedural programming**.
	- In **procedural programming**, the focus is creating "procedures" that implement the program logic.
		- In C++ the "procedures" are called functions.
	- Data objects are passed to these functions, those functions perform operations on the data and then potentially return a result to be used by the caller.
