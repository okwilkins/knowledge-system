## 14.1 — Introduction to object-oriented programming

- Up until now, the type of programming used is called **procedural programming**.
	- In **procedural programming**, the focus is creating "procedures" that implement the program logic.
		- In C++ the "procedures" are called functions.
	- Data objects are passed to these functions, those functions perform operations on the data and then potentially return a result to be used by the caller.

## 14.2 — Introduction to classes

- As useful as structs are, structs have a number of deficiencies that can present challenges when trying to build large, complex programs.

### The class invariant problem

- Perhaps the biggest difficulty with structs is that they do not provide an effective way to document and enforce class invariants.
- In the context of class types, a **class invariant**  is a condition that must be true throughout the lifetime of the object in order for the object to remain in a valid state.
	- An object that has a violated class invariant is said to be in an **invalid state** and unexpected or undefined behaviour may result from further use of that object.

- Consider this struct:

```cpp
struct Fraction {
	int numerator{0};
	int denominator{1};
};
```

- A denominator of `0` is mathematically undefined.
	- Therefore, it would be best to ensure the `denominator` member of a Fraction object is never set to `0`.
	- If it is, then that Fraction object is in an invalid state and undefined behaviour may result from further use of that object.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Fraction {
	int numerator{0}
	int denominator{1};
};

void printFractionValue(const Fraction& f) {
	std::cout << f.numerator / f.denominator << '\n';
}

int main() {
	Fraction f{5, 0};
	printFractionValue(f); // causes a divide by zero error
	
	return 0;
}
```

### A more complex class invariant

- Class invariants become more of a challenge when the members of a strut must have correlated values.

```cpp
#include <string>

struct Employee {
	std::string name{};
	char firstInitial{}; /// should always hold first character of name
};
```

- Relying on the user of an object to maintain class invariants is likely to result in problematic code.

### Introduction to classes

- Just like structs, a **class** is a program-defined compound type that can have many member variables with different types.
- From a technical standpoint, structs and classes are almost identical.
	- Therefore, any example that is implemented using a struct could be implemented using a class, or vice-versa.
	- However, from a practical standpoint, structs and classes might be used differently.

### Defining a class

```cpp
class Employee {
	int m_id{};
	int m_age{};
	double m_wage{};
};
```

### Most of the C++ standard library is classes

- Classes are really the heart and soul of C++.
	- They are so foundation that C++ was originally named "C with classes"!
